1. Replace VGG16 feature extractor to Mobilenet_v2:
                Mobilenet_v2        VGG11
    Accuracy:   ~72%                ~71%
    Complexity: <1 G-FLOPs          >7 G-FLOPs

2. Check quality of result model

3. Clip feature extractor to increase spatial resolution on output feature map.
    Estimate computational complexity between src model as and clipped model O(Classes)

5. Increase resolution of input tensor to increase spatial resolution

4. Retrain detector for less count of object classes (<5) to prove correctness of solution and compare
    to baseline (SSD TF OD API and YOLO Darknet)
